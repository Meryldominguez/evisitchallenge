- If given more time:
  - I would look into more efficient sorting. I dont love using a bubble sort as it is pretty slow.
  - I think the heap would work. 
    - There is a chance I could use just the heap  and have it be much closer to o(n) as well as save memory...
 - Runtime complexity
   - bubbleUp,addToSorted,requestHandled = O(n Log n)
   - top100 = O(1)
   - clear() could be O(n) or O(1) 
     - depending on preferences for Node garbage collection
 - How does your code work?
   - This would be run on a Node Server, and could be attached to whatever takes incoming requests
   - top100() could be called and sent to the frontend, depending on how they would like information displayed, or could be set to a timer and would print to the log every x minutes
 - What other approaches?
   - See my notes/ brainstorming on the top of ipTracker.js
   - Linked List / Heap
   - Ultimately I think heap would be better, as the more frequent requests wouldnt go so far down the pile
 - How to test this?
   - unit tests
      - bubble sort works
      - doesnt crash with bad info
      -  breaks work at the right time
   -  integration
      -  send 10 requests through and check the counter/sorted array
